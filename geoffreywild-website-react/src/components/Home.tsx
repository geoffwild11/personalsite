                I use this area as my playground a bit. I made this iteration in Typescript using React. 
                This is a static web page, but I wanted to play around with React on my own a bit. I originally created
                it using Angular.

            <p>
                "This is a static website. Why are you using React?" As stated before, I wanted to play around with it some. 
                I like that React makes it easy to create functional components that can be re-used throughout the website.
